# Final Project
Instructions on running my code:
My project don't need extra instructions. You can directly run my code, click the link it generated, which will go to my homepage. 
Then you can choose what kind of information you want to see. 
The only thing needs to be pointing out is that I use "selenium" to crawl data, so the source website will appears, 
you can just minimize the website but don't close it until the website finish loading. More details can be found
in my demo video.
